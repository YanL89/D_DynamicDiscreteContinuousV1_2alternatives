# DynamicDiscreteContinuous_2alt
This is the first version of dynamic discrete-continuous choice model which allows TWO alternatives in the discrete choice 

This example is based on simulated data. "input_data_simulation - scale.R" is used to generate input data files which are saved under folder "simulate_data_scale"

Main coding file of the example is named as "estimation_simulated_data - scale.R"

If you have any question about the methodology and application for using this R package, please refer to Chapter 7 of my dissertation https://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/20430. In particular, Section 7.2 - 7.4 metho explains the methdology; Section 7.5 - 7.6 discusses the application and estimation results.
